# UIC CS 502: Computational Biology
In this repo we collected all the work we made for UIC Computational Biology Course by Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf.

The Final Project for the course is taken from Kaggle Human Protein Atlas Competion (https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification)

The dataset used is not avaliable in this repo for dimentional purposes.

The code has been run on Google Cloud Virtual Machine with a Nvidia Tesla K80, beeing that an image classification task it is suggested to run the code on a GPU-enabled machine.
